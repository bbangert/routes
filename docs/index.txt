Routes
++++++

Routes is a Python re-implementation of the `Rails routes system <http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/9>`_
for mapping URL's to Controllers/Actions and generating URL's. Routes makes it easy to create pretty and concise URL's that are RESTful with little effort.

Speedy and dynamic URL generation means you get a URL with minimal cruft (no big dangling query args). Shortcut features like Named Routes cut down on repetitive typing.

Current features:

* Named Routes
* Sophisticated Route lookup and URL generation
* Wildcard path's before and after static parts
* Groupings syntax to allow flexible URL's to accommodate almost any need
* Sub-domain support built-in
* Conditional matching based on domain, cookies, HTTP method (RESTful), and more
* Easily extensible utilizing custom condition functions and route generation functions
* Extensive unit tests

Buzzword Compliance: *REST*, *DRY*

** Sept. 6th, 2006**

Routes 1.4.1 released:

* Added sub_domains option to mapper, along with sub_domains_ignore list for 
  subdomains that are considered equivalent to the main domain. When sub_domains
  is active, url_for will now take a sub_domain option that can alter the host
  the route will go to.
* Added ability for filter functions to provide a _host, _protocol, _anchor arg
  which is then used to create the URL with the appropriate host/protocol/anchor
  destination.
* Patch applied from Ticket #28. Resolves issue with Mapper's controller_scan
  function requiring a valid directory argument. Submitted by Zoran Isailovski.

**July 21, 2006**

Routes 1.4 released:

* Fixed bug with map.resource related to member methods, found in Rails version.
* Fixed bug with map.resource member methods not requiring a member id.
* Fixed bug related to handling keyword argument controller.
* Added map.resource command which can automatically generate a batch of routes intended
  to be used in a REST-ful manner by a web framework.
* Added URL generation handling for a 'method' argument. If 'method' is specified, it
  is not dropped and will be changed to '_method' for use by the framework.
* Added conditions option to map.connect. Accepts a dict with optional keyword args
  'method' or 'function'. Method is a list of HTTP methods that are valid for the route.
  Function is a function that will be called with environ and matchdict where matchdict is
  the dict created by the URL match.
* Fixed redirect_to function for using absolute URL's. redirect_to now passes all args to
  url_for, then passes the resulting URL to the redirect function. Reported by climbus.



**April 30th, 2006**

Routes 1.3.2 released with:

* Fixed _filter bug with inclusion in match dict during matching, reported by David Creemer.
* Fixed improper url quoting by using urllib.encode, patch by Jason Culverhouse.



**April 4th, 2006**

Routes 1.3.1 released with:

* Mapper has an optional attribute ``append_slash``. When set to ``True``, any URL's
  generated will have a slash appended to the end. 
* Fixed prefix option so that if the PATH_INFO is empty after prefix regexp, its set to
  '/' so the match proceeds ok.
* Fixed prefix bug that caused routes after the initial one to not see the proper url
  for matching. Caught by Jochen Kupperschmidt.



**February 25th, 2006**

Routes 1.3 released with:

* Filter functionality when using named routes
* Fixed Python 2.3 incompatibility issue with 1.2
