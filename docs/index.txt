Routes
++++++

Routes is a Python re-implementation of the `Rails routes system <http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/9>`_
for mapping URL's to Controllers/Actions and generating URL's. Routes makes it easy to create pretty and concise URL's that are RESTful with little effort.

Speedy and dynamic URL generation means you get a URL with minimal cruft (no big dangling query args). Shortcut features like Named Routes cut down on repetitive typing.

Current features:

* Named Routes
* Sophisticated Route lookup and URL generation
* Wildcard path's before and after static parts
* Groupings syntax to allow flexible URL's to accommodate almost any need
* Sub-domain support built-in
* Conditional matching based on domain, cookies, HTTP method (RESTful), and more
* Easily extensible utilizing custom condition functions and route generation functions
* Extensive unit tests

Buzzword Compliance: *REST*, *DRY*

News
====

**April 10th, 2007**

Routes 1.6.3:

* Fixed matching so that an attempt to match an empty path raises a
  RouteException. Fixes #44.
* Added ability to use characters in URL's such as '-' and '_' in 
  map.resource. Patch by Wyatt Baldwin. Fixes #45.
* Updated Mapper.resource handling with name_prefix and path_prefix checking
  to specify defaults. Also ensures that should either of them be set, they
  override the prefixes should parent_resource be specified. Patch by Wyatt
  Baldwin. Fixes #42.
* Added utf-8 decoding of incoming path arguments, with fallback to ignoring
  them in the very rare cases a malformed request URL is sent. Patch from
  David Smith.
* Fixed treatment of '#' character as something that can be left off and
  used in route paths. Found by Mike Orr.
* Added ability to specify parent resource to map.resource command. Patch from
  Wyatt Baldwin.
* Fixed formatted route issue with map.resource when additional collection 
  methods are specified. Added unit tests to verify the collection methods
  work properly.
* Updated URL parsing to properly use HTTP_HOST for hostname + port info before
  falling back to SERVER_PORT and SERVER_NAME. Fixes #43.
* Added member_name and collection_name setting to Route object when made with
  map.resource.
* Updated routes.middleware to make the Routes matched accessible as
  environ['routes.route'].
* Updating mapper object to use thread local for request data (such as 
  environ) and middleware now deletes environ references at the end of the
  request.
* Added explicit option to Routes and Mapper. Routes _explicit setting will
  prevent the Route defaults from being implicitly set, while setting Mapper
  to explicit will prevent Route implicit defaults and stop url_for from using
  Route memory. Fixes #38.
* Updated config object so that the route is attached if possible.
* Adding standard logging usage with debug messages.
* Added additional test for normal '.' match and fixed new special matching to
  match it properly. Thanks David Smith.
* Fixed hanging special char issue with 'special' URL chars at the end of a URL
  that are missing the variable afterwards.
* Changed Routes generation and recognition to handle other 'special' URL chars
  , . and ; as if they were /. This lets them be optionally left out of the
  resulting generated URL. Feature requested by David Smith.
* Fixed lookahead assertion in regexp builder to properly handle two grouped
  patterns in a row.
* Applied patch to generation and matching to handle Unicode characters
  properly. Reported with patch by David Smith.


**Jan. 5, 2007**

Routes 1.6.2:

* Fixed issue with method checking not properly handling different letter
  cases in REQUEST_METHOD. Reported by Sean Davis.
* redirect_to now supports config.redirect returning a redirect, not just
  raising one.


**Dec. 29, 2006**

Routes 1.6.1:

* Fixed zipsafe flag to be False as it occasionally was installed zipped.


**Dec. 14th, 2006**

Routes 1.6:

* Fixed append_slash to take effect in the route generation itself instead of
  relying on url_for function. Reported by ToddG.
* Added additional url_for tests to ensure map.resource generates proper named
  routes.
* WARNING: Changed map.resource initialization to accept individual member and
  collection names to generate proper singular and plural route names. Those
  using map.resource will need to update their routes and url_for statements
  accordingly.
* Added additional map.resource recognition tests.
* Added WSGI middleware that does route resolving using new `WSGI.org Routing
  Vars Spec <http://wsgi.org/wsgi/Specifications/routing_args>`_.
* Added _absolute keyword option route connect to ignore SCRIPT_NAME settings.
  Suggested by Ian Bicking.


**Oct. 16th, 2006**

Routes 1.5.2:

* Fixed qualified keyword to keep host port names when used, unless a host
  is specifically passed in. Reported by Jon Rosebaugh.
* Added fully_qualified keyword option to url_for to have it generate a full
  URL. Resolves #29.
* Fixed examples in url_for doc strings so they'll be accurate.


**Oct. 4th, 2006**

Routes 1.5.1:

* Fixed bug with escaping part names in the regular expression, reported by
  James Taylor.


**Sept. 19th, 2006**

Routes 1.5 released:

* Significant updates to map.resource and unit tests that comb it thoroughly
  to ensure its creating all the proper routes (it now is). Increased unit
  testing coverage to 95%.
* Added unit tests to ensure controller_scan works properly with nested
  controller files and appropriately scans the directory structure. This
  brings the Routes util module up to full code coverage.
* Fixed url_for so that when the protocol is changed, port information is
  removed from the host.
* Added more thorough testing to _RequestConfig object and the ability to
  set your own object. This increases testing coverage of the __init__ module
  to 100%.
* Fixed bug with sub_domain not maintaining port information in url_for and
  added unit tests. Reported by Jonathan Rosebaugh.
* Added unit tests to ensure sub_domain option works with named routes, cleaned
  up url_for memory argument filtering. Fixed bug with named routes and sub_domain
  option not working together, reported by Jonathan Rosebaugh.
* Changed order in which sub-domain is added to match-dict so it can be used
  in a conditions function.


**Sept. 6th, 2006**

Routes 1.4.1 released:

* Added sub_domains option to mapper, along with sub_domains_ignore list for 
  subdomains that are considered equivalent to the main domain. When sub_domains
  is active, url_for will now take a sub_domain option that can alter the host
  the route will go to.
* Added ability for filter functions to provide a _host, _protocol, _anchor arg
  which is then used to create the URL with the appropriate host/protocol/anchor
  destination.
* Patch applied from Ticket #28. Resolves issue with Mapper's controller_scan
  function requiring a valid directory argument. Submitted by Zoran Isailovski.

**July 21, 2006**

Routes 1.4 released:

* Fixed bug with map.resource related to member methods, found in Rails version.
* Fixed bug with map.resource member methods not requiring a member id.
* Fixed bug related to handling keyword argument controller.
* Added map.resource command which can automatically generate a batch of routes intended
  to be used in a REST-ful manner by a web framework.
* Added URL generation handling for a 'method' argument. If 'method' is specified, it
  is not dropped and will be changed to '_method' for use by the framework.
* Added conditions option to map.connect. Accepts a dict with optional keyword args
  'method' or 'function'. Method is a list of HTTP methods that are valid for the route.
  Function is a function that will be called with environ and matchdict where matchdict is
  the dict created by the URL match.
* Fixed redirect_to function for using absolute URL's. redirect_to now passes all args to
  url_for, then passes the resulting URL to the redirect function. Reported by climbus.



**April 30th, 2006**

Routes 1.3.2 released with:

* Fixed _filter bug with inclusion in match dict during matching, reported by David Creemer.
* Fixed improper url quoting by using urllib.encode, patch by Jason Culverhouse.



**April 4th, 2006**

Routes 1.3.1 released with:

* Mapper has an optional attribute ``append_slash``. When set to ``True``, any URL's
  generated will have a slash appended to the end. 
* Fixed prefix option so that if the PATH_INFO is empty after prefix regexp, its set to
  '/' so the match proceeds ok.
* Fixed prefix bug that caused routes after the initial one to not see the proper url
  for matching. Caught by Jochen Kupperschmidt.



**February 25th, 2006**

Routes 1.3 released with:

* Filter functionality when using named routes
* Fixed Python 2.3 incompatibility issue with 1.2

* Mapper debugging capabilities
* URL generation enhancements for application portability
* Static named routes


**January 13th, 2006**

Routes 1.1 released with:

* Easier integration
* Powerful Groupings syntax for more flexibility
