==================
Integrating Routes
==================

Routes is built to function with any Python web framework that utilizes a MVC style
approach to design. Though it can be used completely outside of a MVC context as well.

For full integration with a web framework, several steps should be done during different
phases of the request cycle. The web framework developer should also have a way to
add routes to the mapper.

**Terminology**:

Framework Integrator
    Typically the person who is working to integrate routes into a web framework
    
Web/Framework Developer
    The web application developer using the web framework

-----------
Route Setup
-----------

The web framework developer will need a place to add routes that will be used during the
`url resolution`_ phase. Commonly the mapper object will be directly exposed in a configuration
file::

    # some_config.py
    from routes import *
    
    m = Mapper()
    m.connect(':controller/:action/:id')
    
The developer can then add additional routes as they see fit. The Framework Integrator should
make sure that their code takes care of using the Mapper instance and preserving it somewhere
for use by the framework.

---------------------------
Pre-Loading the Controllers
---------------------------

Due to the way Routes makes use of regular expressions for URL recognition, Routes requires a
valid list of Controller's before it can match URL's. Controller names can contain any
character including ``/``. Once the controller list is created, the Mapper method
`create_regs <class-routes.base.Mapper.html#create_regs>`_ should be called::

    m.create_regs(['content','admin/comments','blog'])
    
After this step, the Mapper object is now ready to match URL's.

--------------
URL Resolution
--------------

When the URL is looked up, it should be matched against the Mapper. When matching an incoming URL, it
is assumed that the URL path is the only string being matched. All query args should be stripped before
matching::

    m.connect('articles/:year/:month', controller='blog', action='view', year=None)

    m.match('/articles/2003/10')
    # {'controller':'blog', 'action':'view', 'year':'2003', 'month':'10'}

Matching a URL will return a dict of the match results, if you'd like to differentiate between *where*
the argument came from you can use routematch which will return the Route object that has all these
details::

    m.connect('articles/:year/:month', controller='blog', action='view', year=None)
    
    result = m.routematch('/articles/2003/10')
    # result is a tuple of the match dict, and the Route object
    
    # result[0] - {'controller':'blog', 'action':'view', 'year':'2003', 'month':'10'}
    # result[1] - Route object
    # result[1].defaults - {'controller':'blog', 'action':'view', 'year':None}
    # result[1].hardcoded - ['controller', 'action']
    
Your integration code is then expected to dispatch to a controller and action in the dict. How it does
this is entirely up to the framework integrator. Your integration should also typically provide the
web developer a mechanism to access the additional dict values.

Setting up the Request Configuration
====================================

Before you dispatch the request to the Controller, a few things need to be configured to ensure that the
`redirect_to <module-routes.html#redirect_to>`_ and `url_for <module-routes.html#url_for>`_ function
properly.

A special `thread-safe singleton class <module-routes.html#request_config>`_ is used to hold this
information::

    from routes import request_config
    
    config = request_config()
    
    config.mapper = m                  # Your mapper object
    config.mapper_dict = result        # The dict from m.match for this URL request
    config.host = hostname             # The server hostname
    config.protocol = port             # Protocol used, http, https, etc.
    config.redirect = redir_func       # A redirect function used by your framework, that is
                                       # expected to take as the first non-keyword arg a single 
                                       # full or relative URL

Reference the `docs for request_config <module-routes.html#request_config>`_ when setting this object up
to ensure you've initialized everything needed.

This object needs to be configured for every request before controller dispatch.

------------
Distributing
------------

You should now be ready to use Routes with your framework. If you're using setuptools, the easiest way
to make sure that Routes is installed along with your framework is to add it to your package
requirements.
