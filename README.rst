Routes is a Python re-implementation of the Rails routes system for mapping
URL's to Controllers/Actions and generating URL's. Routes makes it easy to
create pretty and concise URL's that are RESTful with little effort.

Speedy and dynamic URL generation means you get a URL with minimal cruft
(no big dangling query args). Shortcut features like Named Routes cut down
on repetitive typing.

View the INSTALL for installation instructions. Routes will typically be
running integrated into an existing framework.

For developers wishing to integrate Routes with their web
application/framework, consult docs/integration.txt.
